### [M-#] Looping through players array to check for duplicates in `PuppyRaffle::enterRaffle` is a potential denial of service (DoS) attack, incremeting gas costs for future entrants

**Description:** The `PuppyRaffle::enterRaffle` function loops through the `players` array to check for duplicates. However, the longer the `PuppyRaffle::players` array is, the more checks a new player will have to make. This means the gas costs for players who enter right when the raffle stats will be dramatically lower than those who enter later. Every additional address in the `players`array, is an additional check the loop will have to make.

```javascript
        // @audit DoS
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length - 1; i++) {
            for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {
                require(players[i] != players[j], "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
            }
        }
```

**Impact:** The gas costs for raffle entrants will greatly increase as more players enter the raffle. Discouraging later users from entering, and causing a rush at the start of a raffle to be one of the first entrants in the queue.

**Proof of Concept:** Add the following to the `PuppyRaffleTest.t.sol` test file;

If we have 2 sets of 100 players enter, the gas costs will be as such:

- 1st 100 players: ~6252047 gas
- 2st 100 players: ~18068137 gas

This is more than 3x more expensensive for the second 100 players.

```javascript
    function test_denialOfService() public {
        vm.txGasPrice(1);

        // Let's enter 100 players
        uint256 playersNum = 100;
        address[] memory players = new address[](playersNum);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < playersNum; i++) {
            players[i] = address(i);
        }

        // see how much gas it costs
        uint256 gasStart = gasleft();
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * playersNum}(players);
        uint256 gasEnd = gasleft();

        uint256 gasUsedFirst = (gasStart - gasEnd) * tx.gasprice;

        console.log("Gas cost of the first 100 players", gasUsedFirst);

        // now for the 2nd 100 players
        address[] memory playersTwo = new address[](playersNum);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < playersNum; i++) {
            playersTwo[i] = address(i + playersNum);
        }

        // see how much gas it costs
        uint256 gasStartSecond = gasleft();
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * playersNum}(playersTwo);
        uint256 gasEndSecond = gasleft();

        uint256 gasUsedSecond = (gasStartSecond - gasEndSecond) * tx.gasprice;

        console.log("Gas cost of the 2nd 100 players", gasUsedSecond);

        assert(gasUsedSecond > gasUsedFirst);
    }

**Recommended Mitigation:** There a few recommended mitigations.

1. Consider allowing duplicates. Users can make new wallet addresses anyways, so a duplicate check doesn't prevent the same person from entering multiple times, only the same wallet address.

2. Consider using a mapping to check duplicates. This would allow you to check for duplicates in constant time, rather than linear time. You could have each raffle have a uin256 id, and the mapping would be a player address mapped to the raffle Id.

```diff
+   mapping(address => uint256) public addressToRaffleId;
+   uint256 public constant RAFFLE_ID = 0;
    .
    .
    .
    function enterRaffle(address[] memory newPlayers) public payable {
        require(msg.value == entranceFee * newPlayers.length, "PuppyRaffle: Must send enough to enter raffle");
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < newPlayers.length; i++) {
            players.push(newPlayers[i]);
+           addressToRaffleId[newPlayers[i]] = RAFFLE_ID;
        }

-       // Check for duplicates
+       // Check for duplicates only from the new players
+       for (uint256 i = 0; i < newPlayers.length; i++) {
+           require(addressToRaffleId[newPlayers[i]] != RAFFLE_ID, "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
+       }
-       for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length - 1; i++) {
-           for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {
-               require(players[i] != players[j], "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
-           }
-       }
        emit RaffleEnter(newPlayers);
    }


```
